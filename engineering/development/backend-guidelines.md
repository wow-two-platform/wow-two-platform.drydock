## Repo-specific deltas

- **SDK:** every layer runs on `WoW2.Sdk.Backend.Beta` — host floor, mediator, `AppResult` / `AppError`, validation,
  identity, the GitHub and GHCR clients, the bespoke SQL migrator and the test harness. New infrastructure proves inline,
  then extracts to the SDK ([backlog](../planning/backlog.md) § SDK adoption).
- **Controllers** send a request through `ISender`, `Match` the result and map a failure with
  `IErrorHttpStatusCodeMapper.ToStatusCode`. No logic in the host.
- **Audited commands** implement `IAuditedCommand` and land in the hash-chained `audit_entries` trail; never put a value
  in one.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL; hand-authored `Wheelhouse.Persistence/Migrations/{NNN-name}/{Apply,Rollback}.sql`, applied
  on boot. EF Core maps only; no EF migrations or `EnsureCreated`.
- **Outbound work** — the runner process, the vault admin API, GitHub — lives in `Infrastructure` behind Application
  ports, never in controllers or the Domain.
- **Ports:** HTTPS 8210 / HTTP 8211.

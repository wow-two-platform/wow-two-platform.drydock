# Wheelhouse — Frontend Development Guidelines

*Last updated: 2026-09-29*

Shared frontend conventions live in `wow-two-ws/conventions/development/frontend/`.
This document records Wheelhouse-specific choices; the workspace design is in
[architecture](../architecture/architecture.md#workspace).

## Stack

- Vue 3 Composition API · Vue Router · Vite 6 · TypeScript (strict) · Tailwind v4 · Node 24 · pnpm workspace.
- UI: published **`@wow-two-beta/ui-vue@0.0.7`**. Use its components, forms, queries and Result contracts. Shared capability gaps belong in the SDK; product composition stays here.
- `bootstrap/index.css` imports `tailwindcss` and `@wow-two-beta/ui-vue/styles.css`; its `@source` includes SDK utilities.
- `bootstrap/query.ts` and `bootstrap/form.ts` are the application adapter pins. Integration functions decode wire payloads with Zod and return SDK `Result<T, ApiFailure>` values.

## Conventions

- One app, `apps/web` (`@wheelhouse/web`), in the pnpm workspace at `engineering/codebase/wheelhouse.frontend-services/`. API client is same-origin (`/api/...`); HTTPS dev server `:5174` proxies to HTTPS backend `:8210` (see `apps/web/vite.config.ts`); `pnpm dev:http` serves plain HTTP for headless previews. Preserve secure cookies and forwarded origin during GitHub authentication.
- Production: `pnpm deploy` (`scripts/deploy.mjs`) builds the app and copies `apps/web/dist/` into the API's `wwwroot` (single-host serving). Idempotent — `wwwroot` is wiped + repopulated each run.
- `pnpm typecheck` runs `vue-tsc` and the SFC compiler gate. `pnpm test` checks inventory/selection, API decoding and sensitive-form lifecycles. `pnpm build` includes typechecking and lazy route bundling.

## Repo-specific deltas

- Control-plane workspace only — single operator, never public. Secret writes and token minting bypass the mutation cache. Plaintext stays inside the active dialog; abort/generation guards prevent dismissed requests restoring it. Failed writes preserve editable input; successful writes and context changes clear values and form baselines.
- First loads use `LoadState` with SDK `SkeletonState`; explicit refresh uses the local `useRefresh` timing helper and skeletons. Cached content remains visible with an error when background reads fail.
- A page's primary action goes in the shared header through `PageActions` and Vue Teleport; the page owns the dialog.
- Theme tokens live in `bootstrap/index.css` (`:root` and `.dark`); `public/theme.js` applies the remembered scheme before the first paint.
- The Workspace route combines a product rail, environment/service surface and contextual inspector. Top navigation retains URL product/target selection. Invalid explicit selections remain unavailable rather than silently selecting another target.
- Registry/runner association uses explicit bindings in `application/workspace/WorkspaceInventory.ts`. Registry lifecycle, observed runtime condition and deployment outcome remain separate facts.
- Host vitals are current snapshots; the shared timer refreshes visible subscribers every 60 seconds. Deployment follow-up polls every three seconds. Neither implies retained host history.
- Deployments submit approved target/release IDs. Reconciliation submits the authoritative remote active rollout ID and requires exact typed target confirmation. API action headers remain explicit.
- Clearing authentication invalidates the query session and HTTP request scope, preventing previous-session responses entering a replacement session.
